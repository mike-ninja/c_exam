rostring breakdown

Conceptual overview:

skip_whitespace

MAIN
If exactly 0 arguments have been given
	print a newline and exit
set char *str to the beginning of the first argument
create an array named "words" containing several thousand char * pointers initialized to NULL
set int i to 0
while str points to a non-'\0' character
	while str points to a whitespace, non-'\0' character
		set the character pointed to by str to '\0'
		increment str forward one character
	if str points to a non-'\0' character
		set element i in the array words to the value of str
	while str points to a non-whitespace, non-'\0' character
		increment str forward one character
	if str points to a non-'\0' character
		set i to its own value plus 1
set int i to 1
while element i of the array words is a non-NULL pointer
	print the string pointed to by element i of words
	set i to its own value plus 1
if element 0 of the array words is a non-NULL pointer
	print the string pointed to by element 0 of words
print a newline
