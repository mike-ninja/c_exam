pgcd breakdown

Conceptual overview:
If exactly 2 arguments have been given
	print a newline and exit
set int x to integer value of first argument
set int y to integer value of second argument
set int test to the smaller of x and y
while test is greater than 0
	if test divides x evenly and test divides y evenly
		print test and exit
	else
		set test to its own value minus 1
print a newline and exit.
