LLDB is a software debugger available from the command line. It has broad & varied capabilities, but one of its most helpful use cases at 42 is in-exam troubleshooting. Here are the basic commands to get you started.

1) Compile with debug symbols:
    gcc -g filename.c
    
    ^^ this will output both an a.out file AND an a.out.dSYM (debug SYMbols) file - be careful not to push either!)

2) Start LLDB:
    lldb a.out
    
3) Set a breakpoint:
    b function_name
    
    You can set multiple breakpoints, or none at all. Setting no breakpoints is a good way to step through your code to find the source of a segfault.
    
4) Run your code:
    r
    
   Run your code with arguments:
    r "argument" "argument"
    
5) Move forward one step:
    n

6) Help:
    help
    
7) Exit LLDB:
    q
    
USING THE GUI
    LLDB has a handy graphic interface that can make it easier to use. Use command "gui" from within LLDB to launch the interface.
